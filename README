To run the seam carver, run the ResizeDemo.py script:

[1] run ResizeDemo.py name-of-png-file num-rows-to-remove num-cols-to-remove

for example:
[1] run ResizeDemo.py "12x10.png" 3 2

The ResizeDemo.py should be modified to run large images. You don't want to print an energy array for large images.
